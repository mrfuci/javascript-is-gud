# javascript 2.5D shooter

A side scrolling 2.5D shooter made in javascript.

- version 0.1 - only the basics you got the base website, the simple style and a movable square, and a lot of placeholders
		- if I feel like it tommorow I will do the shooting mechanic and make the background scroll with the players movement
- version 0.1.5 - Some improvement has been made. The player is no longer a square. You can shoot now even tho there is nothing to shoot
		- at. The sprite looks like shit but I will fix it. So stuff I want to get done is : enemies, a background, a good looking sprite
